# MER - Modeling Event Recorder

MER (Modeling Event Recorder) is an Eclipse plugin that captures and serializes modeling events from Sirius graphical editor sessions in the XES standard log format. The plugin records user interactions, changes, and actions performed within the Sirius graphical editor, allowing you to analyze and gain insights into the modeling process.

## Features

- Capture modeling events in the Sirius graphical editor sessions.
- Serialize the recorded events in the XES standard log format.
- Export and save event logs to the metadata folder in the Elipse workspace.

## Installation and Usage
MER is now available on Eclipse Marketplace. Watch the tutorial video for more info.

### Prerequisites

- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)

### Steps

1. Clone the MER repository to your local machine.
   
2. Import the project into Eclipse as an existing eclipse plugin project.

3. Run the project as an Eclipse application.

4. Create a modeling project.

5. Open the Sirius graphical editor.

6. Perform modeling actions and interactions in the Sirius graphical editor.

8. Right-click on the modeling project in the project explorer and close the project.

9. The recorded events will be serialized in the XES standard log format and can be saved for further analysis.

## How It Works

MER integrates seamlessly with the Eclipse IDE and hooks into the Sirius graphical editor's event system. It registers event listeners via EMF Notification API to capture various user interactions, changes, and actions performed during the modeling session. The plugin then converts these events into XES standard log format, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of process mining and analysis tools.

The XES log files generated by MER can be easily imported into popular process mining tools like ProM, Disco, or any other tool that supports the XES format.
